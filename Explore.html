For the most part, it confirms what doctors have already noticed: that the coronavirus seems to mostly be sparing children, for reasons that are not entirely understood.
Of the few children who do develop serious cases, those under 5 are the most at-risk, with infants under 1 year of age at the greatest danger, according to the study, which was published online in the journal Pediatrics.
But even those types of cases were few and far between. A total of 94.1 percent of the children were either asymptomatic or had mild or moderate cases, and only 5.9 percent of them had critical or severe cases, significantly lower than the 18.5 percent of adult patients who fell into that category in China during the same time frame, according to the study authors. Just one child died of the illness in China: a 14-year-old boy in Hubei, the province where the outbreak originated.
The coronavirus and the illness it causes, COVID-19, have infected more than 200,000 people worldwide and killed more than 8,000.

Of the 125 children in the China study who became severely or critically ill, 76 were age 5 or younger. Forty were infants under 1 year old.

The study found no gender differences in which children caught the virus or how severely they got it.

The study is important because it makes clear that children are indeed catching the coronavirus, disproving one possibility that experts had considered about why young patients did not seem to be as affected by it as older ones, said Dr. Buddy Creech, associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital.

"One of the theories that was out there at first was, 'Are children not being as exposed? Are they even getting infected with this?' And this suggests that they definitely are. And they’re at risk for transmitting," he said.

"It lets us know that certainly some children are capable of developing severe disease," Creech added. "Just because it’s much more uncommon for children to get severe disease, these data show it is indeed possible."
Children's relative immunity to the disease has puzzled experts, who have several working theories for why kids are faring better. As people age, their immune systems weaken; this potentially gives children an edge over the virus and gives their bodies a more controlled immune response to it. Children are constantly exposed to other coronaviruses, including some that cause the common cold, which could give them some cross-protection against this one. Their lungs are also healthier, having been exposed to fewer pollutants, which could help.

The latest theory to gain steam has to do with a receptor that the virus binds to on human lung cells called the angiotensin converting enzyme II, or ACE2, receptor. That receptor is what other coronaviruses, such as the virus that causes SARS, bind to. Children may have fewer or less mature versions of that receptor, which may give them a smaller viral load when they get exposed.

Despite promising signs that children are fending off the virus well, experts caution that premature infants and children with underlying chronic health conditions should still be considered high-risk for developing complications.

  35-year-old Fateh Singh, a coronavirus survivor from Punjab, has asked people to be cautious, not afraid of the disease.
  Singh, who was undergoing treatment at the civil hospital in Nawanshahr district of Punjab, tested negative twice on April 4
  and 5.
  He and his family members were admitted to the hospital on March 19. Singh's 70-year-old father had died recently due to
  coronavirus.
  “If anyone contracts coronavirus, one should get treatment for that and should not be scared of it. This can be treated. Have
  courage and keep yourself internally strong. And there is no need to worry,” Singh said in a video message.
  He also asked people to maintain hygiene and wash their hands regularly to keep the deadly disease at bay. In his video
  message, Singh thanked the health staff at the civil hospital for taking care of patients.
  COVID-19 survivor beat isolation blues through action movies (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/movies), video
  calls to wife</p>
  <p style="text-align:left;"><u>Bingeing on action movies, hours-long video calls helped a coronavirus survivor:-</u><br><br>
  The 29-year-old, who did not wish to be named, was discharged from the Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, on
  April 1 after he tested negative for the virus in his second consecutive report.
  The Gurgaon resident was tested COVID-19 positive on March 21, soon after his return from an official trip in the UK.
  Though aware of the fact that he has to stay put in the isolation ward of the hospital for at least 14 days, he said after fourfive days, no matter how hard one tries "boredom and frustration" starts creeping in.
  He said he will always be indebted to his wife for the several video calls, and the streaming apps for showing latest action
  movies that kept him "busy and happily engaged" during such times of distress.
  On movies, he said he was binge-watching latest action movies and series.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p style="text-align:left;"><u>'Medical care, patient's willpower helped septuagenarian recover</u><br>
  A 73-year-old Delhi man with co-morbid conditions has recovered from COVID-19 and doctors have attributed his survival to
  medical care and the patient's "willpower to live"
  Manmohan Singh, a resident of Jangpura area in south Delhi, was discharged on Tuesday after undergoing treatment for
  COVID-19 at the LNJP Hospital.
  "He has so many co-morbid conditions resulted to old age, from ailments in heart, kidney to blood pressure and coronary
  heart conditions. It was his will power to live that pulled him through," Medical Superintendent of the hospital, J C Passey
  said.
  He attributed his recovery to patient care given by doctors at the hospital, high-quality equipment, and the patient's fighting
  spirit.
  If the man had given up, perhaps "we would have lost him," he added.
  His survival will give a lot of hope to other old patients and their families, many of whom are suffering from fear psychosis,
  he said.<br><br>
  <u>62-year-old in Noida recovers. Her advice: Stay upbeat:-</u>
<br>
  It began with a cough that wouldn’t go away, followed by breathlessness and fever. The 62-year-old woman from Noida and
  her son had travelled to Denmark.
  And soon, these two and the rest of the family as well, became the city’s second biggest cluster with seven cases.
  Now, the 62-year-old is back home, the first senior citizen in Noida to have recovered, and she has one advice to share —
  stay positive.
  Two things, she said, made it possible for her to see herself through her time in hospital — a supportive medical staff and
  staying positive. “First, you hear about the disease and get scared. Then, you find yourself in the middle of it, your own
  situation worsens. And when you overcome it all and come home, people avoid you and your family. But I tell my children:
  remain strong and think positive. There is no point thinking about how people respond. We should stay away, right now at
  least, as it’s best for everyone. Just follow the treatment protocol and mentally prepare yourself. That’s how you get better,”
  she said.
  The mother and son were discharged last Friday after they recovered. Now she waits for her husband, daughter-in-law and
  two grandchildren to get home

<p style="text-align:left;"><u>Diabetics need not overly worry about coronavirus: Survivor :-</u>
A 51-year-old coronavirus patient with a history of diabetes and hypertension, who has been discharged from a hospital in
Kolkata after recovery, on Tuesday said he was in a positive frame of mind during his treatment and that diabetics should
not be worried as long as their sugar levels are under control.
"Diabetics should not fear as they can be cured of the COVID-19 disease," Gopi Krishna Agarwal said, adding that since his
sugar level is not very high, it was not much of a problem for him.
Medical experts have been saying that if diabetes is kept under control, a coronavirus patient with diabetes can be treated
as any other non-diabetic COVID-19 patient.
"The doctors were good and they have successfully done their job," he said.</p>
